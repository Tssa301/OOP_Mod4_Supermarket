OOP_Mod4_Supermarket

In this hands-on activity:

The objective of this hands-on activity is to implement the basic classes to use in a supermarket. We will need to store information on Customers, Employees, Stockers and Subcontractors. We need to know everyone's first name, last name, identification number, address and telephone number.

You should create a Market class that has a Market employees method that, when you pass it a list of market employees, it prints all their characteristics per screen.
